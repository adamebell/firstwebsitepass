							<h2>Rules</h2>
							<p><br /><strong>Overview</strong><br />Four on the Floor is a racing game in which players take turns choosing cubes that the racers are going to scramble for to feed their engines. The first player to cross the finish line wins.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Setup</strong><br />To start the game, first lay down a track using the track segments and Speed Limit chits. The end of the rulebook has the recommended track configuration for your first few games.</p>
<p><br />Find four objects that everyone at the table can distinguish, and get a number of each of those objects equal to two more than the number of players. Put these in a bowl or other similar container. We typically use different colored cubes, but any objects that are similarly sized will do. For the rest of the rulebook, these will be referred to as simply &lsquo;cubes&rsquo; stored in the &lsquo;Bowl of Cubes&rsquo;.</p>
<p><br />Find a cup that won&rsquo;t break with rough use; this will be used as the Concealment Cup.</p>
<p><br />Each player will choose an object to represent their racer and place it on the starting space.</p>
<p><br />Each player will draw a &ldquo;Gear 1&rdquo; Transmission card and place it in front of them and then grabs a cube of their choice from the pool.</p>
<p><br />The player who most recently won a race will be the first dealer.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Round Structure</strong><br />The game is played in rounds until one racer crosses the finish line. Each round plays out the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The dealer will choose a number of cubes from the Bowl of Cubes equal to the number of players and place them in the Concealment Cup.</li>
<li>The dealer expels the cubes from the Concealment Cup in a manner that the group has deemed acceptable.</li>
<li>All players, including the dealer, race to grab one cube of their choice.</li>
<li>If the player now has the cubes required to activate their next gear, they must spend them and move up to the next gear. Then, players can choose to spend cubes to move down to the previous gear. (See section &lsquo;Changing Gears&rsquo;)</li>
<li>All players now move their racer a number of spaces along the track equal to their current gear. If they cross a space with a Speed Limit that is lower than their current gear, they Spin Out (see section &lsquo;Spin Out&rsquo;)</li>
<li>The dealer passes to the left; pass the Bowl of Cubes and Concealment Cup to the next player.</li>
</ol>
<p><br /><strong>Changing Gears</strong><br />If, after grabbing cubes, a player is eligible to shift into the next gear, they must return those cubes to the Bowl of Cubes and move to that gear. They must then draw a Transmission Card of the next gear if they do not have one already.</p>
<p><br />Players can then choose to either shift down a gear a gear or shift up two gears, if they are eligible to do so.</p>
<p>A player is eligible to move into a gear if they currently possess a Transmission Card of the desired gear and each of the cubes listed on that card.</p>
<p>Once you draw a Transmission Card, you cannot lose it &ndash; that will be how you shift into that gear for the remainder of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Spin Out</strong><br />If, during a racer&rsquo;s movement, they enter a track segment with a Speed Limit that is lower than their current gear, they will Spin Out. When a player spins out, they must return all of their cubes to the Bowl of Cubes and start back at Gear 0 on their current space.<br />Sample Map:</p>
